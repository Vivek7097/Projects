This project is a website that I made using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The website allows users to browse and search for movies from the Movie Database (TMDB) API, which provides information about movies, TV shows, actors, and more. Users can also view movie details, watch trailers, and add movies to their favorites list. The website uses various React features and hooks, such as useState, useEffect, useRef, and custom hooks. It also uses React Router for navigation and Axios for fetching data from the API. The website is responsive and has a simple and elegant design.
